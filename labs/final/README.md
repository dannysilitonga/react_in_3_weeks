# Final solution - Dinner And A Movie Food Ordering

This solution includes everything in the labs. But we added more to it so that you can see examples of implementing other things. In addition to the requirements in the labs, it also ...
- Uses TypeScript instead of plain old JavaScript
- Separates utilities and the repository
- Implements authentication by injecting an `Authorization`` header with a JWT bearer token.
